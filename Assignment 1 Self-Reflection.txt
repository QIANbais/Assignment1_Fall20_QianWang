I use python a lot and I am new to C#, it took me some time to get fimiliar with the syntax in C#. I think it's always good to learn some new stuff. So, I chose C# as the language in this assignment.
For the questions, I think most of them are moderate except the last one which I know is a classic Dynamic Programming problem. I haven't done many problems in this type of algorithm, need to practice more. I spent about 6-8 hours probably to finalize this assignment. Question 4 and 6 are interesting and good questions. I am hoping that linked list and tree problems can be covered in future.
